Pi == Processing ideas
==============================
Processing ideas (alpha)<br>
The Processing ide web application http://www.processingideas.com/<br>
Languages: Javascript + Php<br>

<h2>The first idea</h2>
Pi is a web tool dedicated to Processing creatives. It aims to provide a web space to create, exhibit and share interactive works, drawings and animations written in the Processing http://processing.org/ language.<br>
Pi uses the javascript port of Processing http://processingjs.org/ allowing users to code in javascript as well.<br>
Other libraries could be added in the future (imagine Paper.js http://paperjs.org/ or Raphael.js http://raphaeljs.com/), mixing all these possibilities together within a common environment.<br>
If you can embed a YouTube video or an swf Flash file in any web page, why shouldn't be as easy to embed a Processing sketch or any other canvas based application?

<h2>Browser compatibility</h2>
Processing sketches are drawn on the canvas element: canvas support is mandatory.<br>
Only modern browsers are supported: IE9+ (i'll only target 10+ soon), Chrome 23+, Firefox 12+, Opera 12+, Safari 5.1+.

<h2>Mobile app and site</h2>
Pi does not support mobile devices at the moment. A responsive, mobile-friendly and touch site (or a mobile app) will probably be done in the future.
