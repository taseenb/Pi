# THIS PROJECT IS ARCHIVED! (2012 PROJECT)

# Pi == Processing ideas BETA

A Processing editor for the browser.

## Setup

Create a file `secrets.php` at the root with the configuration data needed in `/protected/config/params.php` (DB, email, sandbox). See `secrets-example.php`.

## The original idea

Pi is dedicated to Processing creatives. It aims to provide a convinient space to create, exhibit and share interactive works, drawings and animations written in [Processing](http://processing.org/), a Java-like language for artists and designers.  
Pi runs in the browser and uses [Processing JS](http://processingjs.org/), the javascript port of Processing.

## Mobile app and site

Pi does not support mobile devices at the moment.
