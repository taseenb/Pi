<p>Pi is dedicated to creative coders, artists and designers. 
    It aims to provide an inspiring environment to create, 
    showcase and share interactive works, drawings 
    and animations written in javascript and the <a href='http://processing.org/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Processing</a> 
    language.</p>
<p>Pi currently uses the magical javascript port of Processing, 
    <a href='http://processingjs.org/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Processing JS</a>. 
    Other libraries (like <a href='http://paperjs.org/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paper.js</a>,
    <a href="http://threejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three.js</a>, etc.) 
    will be supported in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Pi is still under heavy development. 
	This public site is only intended as a temporary 
	presentation and test of the project, with a limited 
	set of features and many
