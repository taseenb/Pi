<p>Pi is a project dedicated to Processing creatives. It aims to provide an inspiring environment to create, exhibit and share interactive works, drawings and animations written in the <a href='http://processing.org/'>Processing</a> language.</p>
Pi uses the magical javascript port of Processing, <a href='http://processingjs.org/'>Processing JS</a>, allowing users to code in javascript as well. 
Other libraries could be added in the future (<a href='http://paperjs.org/'>Paper.js</a>, <a href='http://raphaeljs.com/'>Raphael.js</a>, <a href="http://http://threejs.org/">Tree.js</a>, etc.), to give more tools to coders creativity.</p>
One practical example: if you can embed an image, a video or an swf file in any web page, why shouldn't be as easy to embed and share Processing sketches or any other canvas based application?</p>
